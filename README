Use the Haskell cabal-install to install this Orchid demo:

  cabal configure &&
  cabal build &&
  cabal install

When running the demo for the first time you have to instruct it to extract the
archive containing the demo Darcs repository:

  orchid-demo --extract

Successive runs do not require extraction. The repository can be found in
/tmp/data by default. Make sure /tmp is world writable. The command line
arguments to orchid-demo can be used to change the programs defaults.
